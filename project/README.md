Number Validation Game

# Number Validation Game

## Description
The **Number Validation Game** is an interactive web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interface for users to input two numbers. The game performs two tasks based on the input:

1. It checks whether the first number is **prime** and displays the result.
2. It calculates and shows the **nth Fibonacci number** corresponding to the second input.

This game is a fun and educational way to explore prime numbers and the Fibonacci sequence while practicing basic JavaScript functionality.
